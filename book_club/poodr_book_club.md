# POODR Book Club

Once per week, Level Up participants will take part in a book club, reading [Practical Object Oriented Design in Ruby (POODR)](https://www.poodr.com/) by Sandi Metz. This book was chosen because it demonstrates Object Oriented Programming (OOP) in terms that are highly accessible for those newer to the concept. While the book is written using examples in Ruby, the concepts are universal and you should be able to identify how to implement them using python.

As you are reading, write down any questions you have or concepts that are covered that you want to explore further. Bring these up for discussion during the book club to get input from the other participants.

Here is a suggested break down of the sessions you will hold during your time in the Level Up program and some started discussion questions:

## Week 1
*Chapters 1-2, 34 pages*

### Chapter 1 - Object Oriented Design

1. What problems does OOD aim to solve?

### Chapter 2 - Designing Classes with a Single Responsiblilty

1. What is the Single Responsibility Principal?
2. How does the Single Responsiblity Principal help to deal with change?
3. If following the SRP, what classes would you expect to see for a bath tub?

## Week 2
*Chapters 3-4, 49 pages*

### Chapter 3 - Managing Dependencies

1. What does it mean when code is "coupled"?
2. How does the phrase "depend on things that change less frequently than you" apply to software programs?
3. What are abstractions and how are they used in programming to help manage dependencies?

### Chapter 4 - Creating Flexible Interfaces

1. What is an interface, in programming terms?
2. What is the interface of a movie theater? What are the ways that the public interacts with that interface and what happens behind the scenes?
3. When should you use private methods within a class?
4. What does a Law of Demeter violation say about the code?

## Week 3
*Chapters 5-6, 55 pages*

### Chapter 5 - Reducing Costs with Duck Typing

1. What is a dynamic typed language and how does that relate to duck typing?
2. What are some of the benefits of using duck typing?
3. What is polymorphism and how is it used? How could polymorphism be applied to a class called `Shape`?

### Chapter 6 - Acquiring Behavior Through Interface

1. How does inheritance relate to polymorphism?
2. How do abstractions enable inheritance?
3. What would be a reasonable superclass for a class called `Cat`? What might be a subclass of the `Cat` class?

## Week 4
*Chapters 7-8, 50 pages*

### Chapter 7 - Sharing Role Behavior with Modules

1. When would you use a module as opposed to a class?
2. What antipatterns can be identified to indicate that code could benefit from inheritance?

### Chapter 8 - Combining Objects with Composition

1. What is the difference between inheritance and composition?
2. When would you opt to use inheritance over composition and vice versa?
3. Where do duck types fit amongst inheritance and composition?

## Week 5
*Chapter 9, 49 pages*

### Chapter 9 - Designing Cost-Effective Tests

1. What do we mean by "cost-effective tests"?
2. When does writing tests not make sense?

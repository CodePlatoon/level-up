# Facilitation Guide

The Level Up facilitator is a peer supporter that serves to help keep students accountable and engaged. The facilitator is not responsible for the success of the participantsâ€“rather, you are there to serve as a consistent presence to encourage engagement.

Facilitators are responsible for the following.

## Day 1 Introduction

1. Facilitate introductions. Ask participants to identify themselves and where they live, and talk about what they are hoping to get out of the program. You can also include an ice breaker question like "what are your top 2 favorite ways of consuming potatoes?"
2. Go through the high level course description in the [README](/README.md)
3. Complete the [Team Agreement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QaoVm1F1Rpj4qcuebUd75xFBtK14uo1-K1JYHQ_qT9g/edit?usp=drive_link) with the group participants
4. Have participants make a copy of the [Baseline Ratings for Learning Objectives](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1muEMyxklSZvFR2R5XSabwnC58MC88NrUubUrlkmh-js/edit?usp=drive_link) doc and fill it out
5. Ensure that everyone is set up with access to the materials including joining the #tech_help Slack channel and ordering [POODR](https://www.poodr.com/) for the book club.

## Daily Scrum and Standups

Each morning when you meet the participants, you should go over the syllabus for that day and make sure that everyone understands what independent work they should be working on for the day.

After you have covered what folks should be working on, lead the stand up. Participants should answer the following questions while in stand up:

1. What did you accomplish since the last stand up?
2. What do you plan to do in the next day?
3. Do you have any blockers?

If a participant is blocked, see if the group can help guide them in a direction to get unblocked, and encourage them to seek further assistance in the #tech_help Code Platoon Slack channel. This is also a great place to call out if they are waiting on feedback for a code review to move that process along.

## Weekly Retro

Each Friday you should hold a retro. The exact format of the retro is not important, but the result is. This is an opportunity for participants to remark on the process. Are the learning materials helpful? Are the goals of the challenges well understood? What suggestions do people have to improve the program?

A common and simple retro format could follow:

1. What went well this week?
2. What didn't go so well?
3. What changes should we implement?

## POODR Book Club

![POODR](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5527cdbae4b0ee7b897c2111/1482082417504-4HBH84WUT7P4V7Q2X97C/image-asset.jpeg)

Level Up participants will take part in a weekly reading of [Practical Object Oriented Design in Ruby (POODR)](https://www.poodr.com/). As the book club facilitator, you should help to guide the conversation. Participants should come prepared each week, having read the assigned chapters, and with questions and topics that they want to discuss with the group.

As the facilitator, you need to have also read the assigned chapters and you should come prepared to the sessions with some discussion topics to help to keep the conversation flowing. You are not required to have the answers to the questions that are posed, but you should ask within the group to see if anyone else can provide more clarity from their own understanding. This is a space to learn from each other and provide support.

The book is 240 pages and 9 total chapters. See the [Book Club](/book_club/poodr_book_club.md) section of this guide for suggested schedule and example discussion questions.

## TODO User Story Development

Work with the group to define user stories for the [TODO app](/exercises/3_todo_app.md). Establish the stories as a group, include the acceptance criteria for each ticket, and have everyone in the group make a copy of the ticket. Follow the outlines in the [Agile Development worksheet](/learning_materials/5_agile_development.md).

## Code Reviews

Code reviews during Level Up are peer-to-peer. That means that participants will be reviewing each other's code, versus the code being evaluated by external reviewers, as we did in the past.

Because this will likely be the first time the participants are performing code reviews, you as the facilitator should monitor the code review process. This is particularly important for the students' first few PRs, where the process is unfamiliar and reviewers are not yet comfortable providing feedback to their peers. Monitoring does not mean reviewing the code, though you should consider providing reviews if you are able to. You are, rather, ensuring that the process is consistently adhered to.

The following are things that you as a facilitator should look out for with code reviews.

1. All participants are submitting code for review
2. All participants are taking turns to review code
3. Reviewers are communicating well on the PRs
4. All code reviews are approved before the code is merged

Let's look at some scenarios that may come up that you will want to recognize:

### A participant is not submitting code for review

If you find that someone is not submitting their code for review, try to find out the reasons why.

If the why is because they don't know how to submit code for review, refer them to the Code Reviews section of this guide. You can offer to help them put their first review together.

They may feel shy or embarrased about the code they wrote. If that is the case, make sure to encourage them and explain how code reviews are a great way to facilitate learning and growth. Stress that this is a low risk environment. Explain that code reviews are a great way to practice giving and receiving feedback.

If they are not submitting code for review because they don't have code to submit, gauge whether they are committed to the program and are able to participate at the required level. If they want to participate, but are having a hard time executing, see if they can identify specific blockers and point them to the #tech_help Slack channel to help them get unblocked.

### A participant is not reviewing their peer's code

Again, ask why.

If they don't know how to perform a code review, have them refer to the Code Reviews section to learn what to look for when reviewing code.

Make sure that they know that both reviewing code provides a learning opportunity for both the reviewer and person whose code is being reviewed. That the process becomes easier with more experience and they will feel more comfortable with more code reviews having performed

### Code is going unreviewed

What process are students using to share their code reviews? How can that be tweaked? Discuss in the retros if necessary.

### Broken or low quality code is being merged

Was the code review approved? Did the reviewer follow the Code Reviews guide? Figure out where the process is coming up short.

## Feedback

Collect feedback via the [Level Up Feedback Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSftcohyeSM0VNOvdipNm59t4BcwibfpKdFQ2XILACSiSQylqA/viewform) at the end of the second week and during the 5th week. Encourage participation often and individually for those who have not provided feedback.

## Presentation of completed work

Host the space for participants to share their work in the exercises provided throughout the program. Students will demo final projects at the end of the program, and you can prompt people to share their solutions to the other exercises they are working on (FooBar, Pokemon).

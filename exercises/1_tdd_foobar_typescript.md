# FooBar

## Goal

This project will allow you to practice TDD and Testing in TypeScript.

## Description

Write a function called FooBar that takes input integer _n_ and prints all the numbers from 1 up to _n_ in a new line.

If the number is divisible by 3 then print "Foo"
If the number is divisible by 5 then print "Bar"
If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FooBar"
Otherwise just print the number

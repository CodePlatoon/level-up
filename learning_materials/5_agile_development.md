## Summary

Agile development refers to an iterative philosophy used in software development and project management to help teams produce higher quality software while delivering value early and often through the process.

Teams that follow an agile process are able to quickly adapt to new requirements while keeping projects on time and within budget.

## Agile values and principals

The 4 values of Agile and 12 Agile Principles are defined in the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/). The Agile Manifesto is a short document produced in 2001 by several software developer influencers and the recommendations outlined within are still used to guide development teams today.

### Four Agile Values

1. **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
2. **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
3. **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
4. **Responding to change** over following a plan

### Twelve Agile Principles

1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.
8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
10. Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.
11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

## Benefits of Agile

Some of the benefits of following the Agile methodology include:

### Ability to adapt to new requirements
Just as the name suggests, one of the key benefits of Agile is increased flexibility when dealing with change. This is relevant to software development because it is impossible to fully and completely plan a software development project from the start that is inflexible to requirement changes. Agile helps teams to be adaptable to change and deliver value consistently and effectively.

### Efficiency
Teams that follow Agile meet to prioritize work, and they agree on what is the most important and work from there. They are able to quickly identify blockers and help each other move forward together to meet release goals. This also makes for more predictability in the process.

### Visibility
Stakeholders are involved and engaged throughout the project life cycle, and their opinions are taken into account. They are empowered to request changes and the development team is designed to be able to absorb those changes without impacting project goals.

### Predictability
Agile teams typically work in set durations that allow for easier planning resource allocation and measuring team performance. The shorter, even time periods allow managers to estimate cost and allocate resources more effectively than with longer-term projects that have more unknowns.

### Improved Quality
Another benefit is that by following an iterative process that allows for small changes each time a cycle is repeated, as the team continues in development, opportunities for improvement can be identified and implemented.

### Reduced Risk
During the software development cycle, bugs and obstacles are inevitable. With Agile, the team regularly meets to evaluate their process, and so these risks can be more easily identified and dealt with more quickly before they escalate into large issues.

### Faster Release Cycle
Teams focus on releasing a viable product early in the process and constantly improving on it. They are able to deliver value early and often with a quicker release cycle, enabling teams to receive stakeholder feedback quicker in the process.

## Other project management methodologies

Agile is not the only option when it comes to project management, but it is the most widely used because it addresses some of the disadvantages of other workflows.

### Waterfall

![Waterfall methodology](https://www.umsl.edu/~hugheyd/is6840/images/Waterfall_model.png)

Waterfall is a traditional path of software development that front loads the planning and flows through each phase of development in a structured, linear fashion. Each phase of the Waterfall model is distinct and isolated, and moving on from a phase means that the phase is closed for changes. This option is not well suited for a software development project, as users regularly change their minds when given the opportunity to provide feedback. In Waterfall, the product is not delivered until development is completed, so feedback can only be provided late in the process.

Waterfall does have a place in management of other types of projects that do not need to adapt to frequent changes, such as construction and manufacturing, where change can be incredibly expensive.

### Lean

![Lean Development](https://kruschecompany.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/lean.png)

The Lean methodology is often confused with Agile as they both focus on quicker delivery, user input, and high quality. Lean is more focused on eliminating waste, and when applied incorrectly, can lead to problems with employee satisfaction and retention.

Lean takes its roots in mid 20th century auto manufacturing. Toyota introduced the concept of Lean manufacturing, which includes focusing on small-batch manufacturing to take advantage of economies of scale, empowering workers instead of the managers to help define their work process, and basing production on demand, rather than supply.

The Lean methodology was adapted to software development, but in some applications it may not translate well. While Lean focuses on product quality and development, it is somewhat less flexible than Agile and its smaller cycles may not make it suitable for larger and longer term projects.

## Agile Frameworks

Agile is considered a philosophy, a set of principles that guide how software is developed and projects are managed. Agile principles are applied to project management frameworks that guide the development process.

### Scrum

A popular framework for Agile development is Scrum. A team following the Scrum methodology will have a product owner that helps to define the product and maximize its value, and a Scrum master who is responsible for keeping the project on track. There are also several cross-functional team members, such as developers, quality assurance people, and DevOps members.

Scrum is widely known for its use of “sprints”, a defined cycle of development time that typically starts with sprint planning and ends with a retrospective. Sprints are short, commonly two to four weeks, to incorporate the Agile principles of quick delivery, low risk, and predictability. At the end of each sprint, there should be deliverable software for the users.

### Kanban

Kanban methodology is less structured than Scrum and focuses on visual and continuous progress.

A key feature of Kanban is the Kanban board, where tasks are added to the board and flow across lanes as they are planned, developed, and tested. In that way, a Kanban board will appear similar to a Scrum board. A key difference is that Kanban does not work in fixed sprints as with Scrum. Also on a Kanban board, the flow of stories is guided by where the stories are in the workflow, as there would be a limit to the number of stories allowed in each lane to prevent bottlenecks in the process and limit work-in-progress.

While the process between Kanban and Scrum is different, the Agile principles are the same.

## User Stories

User stories are an important part of the Agile process, regardless of the framework. User stories describe a particular unit of work and explain how that work provides value for the customer.

User stories typically follow one of these patterns:

> “As a [persona], I [want to], [so that].”
> “[Given a scenario], [when thing happens], [then result]”

[Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/user-stories) outlines some considerations you should make when writing user stories:

* **Definition of “done”** — The story is generally “done” when the user can complete the outlined task, but make sure to define what that is.
* **Outline subtasks or tasks** — Decide which specific steps need to be completed and who is responsible for each of them.
* **User personas** — For whom? If there are multiple end users, consider making multiple stories.
* **Ordered Steps** — Write a story for each step in a larger process.
* **Listen to feedback** — Talk to your users and capture the problem or need in their words. No need to guess at stories when you can source them from your customers.
* **Time** — Time is a touchy subject. Many development teams avoid discussions of time altogether, relying instead on their estimation frameworks. Since stories should be completable in one sprint, stories that might take weeks or months to complete should be broken up into smaller stories or should be considered their own epic.
